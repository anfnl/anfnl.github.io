I am an Associate Professor at the University of Lorraine (France), where I teach systematic theology and contemporary philosophy.

My research focuses on theological language, the epistemology of belief and the relationships between contemporary theology and the social sciences.

I am currently working on an [IUF project](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/2850-anthony-feneuil.html) devoted to the political consequences of the social sciences of belief.

For more details, see my [CV](cv/) and [publications](publications/).
