I am an Associate Professor at the University of Lorraine (France), where I teach systematic theology and contemporary philosophy.

My research focuses on theological language, the epistemology of belief, and the relationships between contemporary theology and the social sciences. I completed my PhD in 2013 (on religious experience in Karl Barth and Henri Bergson) and obtained my habilitation in 2020. I am also interested in questions relative to identity, that I investigated through the philosophical and theological question of personal identity, and through literary research ([Rien de caché](https://www.laboretfides.com/product/rien-de-cache/)).

I am founder and Publishing Director of the journal [ThéoRèmes](https://journals.openedition.org/theoremes/).

I am currently working on an [IUF project](https://www.iufrance.fr/les-membres-de-liuf/membre/2850-anthony-feneuil.html) on the political consequences of the social sciences of belief.
